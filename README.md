A JavaScript framework for spatial interfaces.

## About Fluid

Fluid is a JS client-side framework for _spatial interfaces_. Spatial interfaces are GUIs in which the positioning of elements on the screen has meaning to the user. Examples include diagramming applications, visualization applications, and video games. If your screen should have objects the user can click and drag around, if it's based on motion and position rather than clicks, taps, or gestures, then you're probably designing a spatial interface.

Fluid utilizes the power of HTML5 and SVG, and is built on top of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). You can think of it as the power of D3, in a more declarative form, with first-class support for interactivity. Fluid uses ReactJS for two-way data binding, allowing you to structure your application in an MVC pattern. We chose React because it is a small and unopinionated framework to bridge our D3-based rendering layer to a model-view-controller based application layer.
